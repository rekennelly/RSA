# RSA
CIS 306 Final Project

This is an RSA encryption key generator, encyrpter and decrypter. It takes 2 user integer inputs and uses them to generate Java BigInteger values for p and q,
which it then uses to generate public and private RSA keys.

It also allows use to use the generate keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.
