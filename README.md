# RSA Encryption and Decryption
CIS 306 Final Project - Fall 2020

This is an RSA encryption key generator, encyrpter and decrypter. It takes 2 user integer inputs and uses them to generate Java BigInteger values for p and q,
which it then uses to generate public and private RSA keys.

It also allows use to use the generate keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.

It does this all in a Java GUI built using JavaFX.
